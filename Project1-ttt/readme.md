TIC TAC TOE
WOPR theme from Wargames

Introduction:
This is a basic html tic tac toe game that will count up total number of wins and allow the users to reset the game board after each game.
The theme is based on the movie Wargames in which the computer, WOPR or war operations plan response, learns that a nuclear war is not winnable by playing tic tac toe to a stalemate.

Game Play:
Upon loading the game, a prompt appears asking for the name of player 1.  After this is entered, a prompt asks for the name of player 2.
At this point the game can begin and the first player will move.
The first player is automatically assigned X.
The next player moves and the game continues until a player wins or a tie occurs.
At this point, the game can be rest with the Reset Board button, but the counters will continue to log number of wins.
Have fun.

Challenges:
I utilized the pure css framework to create a responsive grid.  
The javascript code for me was definitely the most challenging aspect of this project.  I allotted one day for html and css and one day for javascript with the remaining half day to clear up issues.  In reality I had to leave some of the html and css styling to troubleshoot javascript issues.  Given more time I would make the javascript code more DRY and add some more features.  This is definitely an MVP product in its current state.
